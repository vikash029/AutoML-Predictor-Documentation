AutoML Predictor

AutoML Predictor is a Python framework that automatically selects the best machine learning model for a dataset. It supports both classification and regression problems while handling data preprocessing, model evaluation, and selection.

🔧 Installation

pip install -r requirements.txt

🚀 Usage

import pandas as pd
from src.model_selection import recommend_model

# Load dataset
data = pd.read_csv("dataset.csv")

# Get best model recommendation
best_model = recommend_model(data, target_column="label")
print(f"Best Selected Model: {best_model}")

✨ Features

✅ Automatic Model Selection (Classification & Regression)

✅ Preprocessing (Handles missing values, encoding, scaling)

✅ Multiple Algorithms (Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression, etc.)

✅ Performance Evaluation using Cross-Validation
